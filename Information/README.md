YOU REMEMBER EVERYTHING DOESNT MEAN YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

So i want to build some kind of infomration processing system , i find it difficult to access and distill information through my brain.
it doesnt mean information is not available or i am dumb. it means about useful information and knowledge gaps between those information structures.
generative models are able to fill this gap sometimes by gibberish but if it makes sense then it is wonderful.i call this [information Gradient] <fancy name>

idk if anyone ever read this and even this makes sense to you.
but it will for sure.
